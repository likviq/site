                This situation occurs when people form a queue, such as at the checkout in a self-service store. Fluctuations in the length of the queue in front of the cash register can be described by a convolution of two probability distributions, one of which characterizes the arrival of customers, and the other at the end of their service.<br><br>

                Then you can inform the administration about the expected maximum length of the queue. Obviously, the availability of such information will allow the organization of normal customer service. At the same time, he can make a decision based on the allowable degree of risk, believing that buyers can wait longer than the previously determined time. Probably the answer will vary depending on the day of the week and even the time of day. Conducting operational research will lead to more scientific and more efficient use of available labor.
